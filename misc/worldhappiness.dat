1.    This is the first map to illustrate international differences in happiness.

2.    UK comes 41st out of 178 countries.

3.     UK doing better than most of our similar neighbours and competitors (France 62nd, Italy 50th, Spain 46th, Japan 90th, Chine 82nd, India 125th).  However other counties did do better (Germany 35th, USA 23rd, Ireland 11th).  A full copy of the league table is published below.

4.     Health is more important than wealth or education.  Further analysis was performed to examine the links between satisfaction with life and measures of life expectancy (health), wealth (GDP per capita) and education (access to secondary level education).It was found that satisfaction with life correlated most closely with health (a correlation of .62), followed by wealth (.52) and then education (.51).  (All pearson's r correlations were significant at the p<.001 level)

5.    The map is based on an analysis of the results from over 100 studies.  It uses data published by by UNESCO, the CIA, the New Economics Foundation, the WHO, the Veenhoven Database, the Latinbarometer, the Afrobarometer, and the UNHDR.

6.    The map is being published in a psychology journal in September, and will be presented at a Psychology conference later in the year. 

 

Quotes

Adrian White said “The concept of happiness, or satisfaction with life, is currently a major area of research in economics and psychology, most closely associated with new developments in positive psychology.  It has also become a feature in the current political discourse in the UK.” 

"There is increasing political interest in using measures of happiness as a national indicator in conjuntion with measures of wealth.  A recent BBC survey found that 81% of the population think the Government should focus on making us happier rather than wealthier."
“It is worth remembering that the UK is doing relatively well in this area, coming 41st out of 178 nations”.
 
"Further analysis showed that a nation's level of happiness was most closely associated with health levels (correlation of .62), followed by wealth (.52), and then provision of education (.51)."
 
"The three predictor variables of health, wealth and education were also very closely associated with each other, illustrating the interdependence of these factors."

“There is a belief that capitalism leads to unhappy people.  However, when people are asked if they are happy with their lives, people in countries with good healthcare, a higher GDP per captia, and access to education were much more likely to report being happy.”
“The frustrations of modern life, and the anxieties of the age, seem to be much less significant compared to the health, financial and educational needs in other parts of the World.  The current concern with happiness levels in the UK may well be a case of the 'worried well'."
